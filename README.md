In order to run the program successfully, the user must first download the necessary files contained in requirements.txt. This program requires the user to apply for a Weather Underground API key. After acquiring the key the user must set that key as an environmental variable. Currently the program is setup to use the environmental variable 'WUNDER_KEY' to represent the API key. After downloading the requirements and saving the Weather Underground API key as the environmental variable 'WUNDER_KEY', the user can enter weather_report_output.py into the terminal to run the program.
